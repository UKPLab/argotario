# Read Me (arguegame)

This folder is the project of the front-end of the game. Actually, only the subfolder /www should be deployed to the server, since the rest of the root directory of this project only contains development and cordova related files.

This project is an IonicFramework based project, and thus, can be extended locally by running "ionic serve" in this folder, after installing the Ionic CLI.
